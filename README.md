# Welcome to ReactWiki!

This is a **ReactJS** and **Firebase** Implementation in **ES6**.

I tried to implement all feature which can helpout a person to understand realtime connection of firebase with reactjs.

 - User authentication.
 - Adding Section.
 - Link to the Section with [[Name of Section]] markdown.
 - Add Markdown to Section content.
 - When you edit a section the other user's window will highlight the section to show its being edited and other users cannot edit it unless, first user is completely done with it.
 - ES6, Firebase, ReactJS, Browserify, Babelify
